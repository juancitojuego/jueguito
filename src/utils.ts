// src/utils.ts

// Placeholder for PRNG and stone creation utilities that will be moved or adapted later
// For now, they are not included here to keep this step focused.

Example of how PRNG related functions might be exposed if moved here:

let gamePrng: seedrandom.PRNG;

export function initializeGamePrng(seed: string | number): void {
  gamePrng = seedrandom(seed.toString());
  logMessage(`Game PRNG initialized with seed: ${seed}`);
}

export function getGamePrng(): seedrandom.PRNG {
  if (!gamePrng) {
    // Fallback or error, should be initialized at game start
    logMessage("Warning: Game PRNG accessed before initialization. Initializing with random seed.");
    initializeGamePrng(Date.now().toString());
  }
  return gamePrng;
}

export { createStone, generateNewStoneSeed, mulberry32, StoneQualities };
*/

// The shutdown function from the original index.ts is not directly applicable
// in a browser environment in the same way.
// Game reset/exit logic will be handled by specific UI components.
export function resetGameData(): void {
    // This would typically involve:
    // 1. Clearing localStorage (or parts of it related to the game)
    // 2. Resetting all SolidJS stores to their default states
    // 3. Potentially redirecting the user or re-rendering the App component
    alert("Game data reset functionality not fully implemented yet.");
